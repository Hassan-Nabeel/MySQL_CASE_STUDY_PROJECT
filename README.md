# MySQL_CASE_STUDY_PROJECT
The README file contains the description of the following projects:

## 1. Danny's Diner

- Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
- He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
- Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

 Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
  -	sales
  -	menu
  -	members

 The following topics relevant to the Danny’s Diner case study are covered lots of depth in the SQL:
   -	Common Table Expressions
   -	Group By Aggregates
   -	Window Functions for ranking
   -	Table Joins

## 2. Pizza Runner
- Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth.
- He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.
- All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

 Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
 This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:
  -	Pizza Metrics
  -	Runner and Customer Experience
  -	Ingredient Optimisation
  -	Pricing and Ratings
  -	Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)

 The following topics relevant to the Pizza Runner case study are covered lots of depth in the Serious SQL course:
  -	Common table expressions
  -	Group by aggregates
  -	Table joins
  -	String transformations
  -	Dealing with null values
  -	Regular expressions
